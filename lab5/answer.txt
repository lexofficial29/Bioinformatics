1. Repetitive regions

Many parts of DNA have repeats like:
ATATATAT or AAAA or ACCACCACC

2. Incomplete strings

If the random reads don't cover every part of the genome enough times some information is lost

3. Computational issues

I used De Bruijn graphs to speed it up but normally it would've taken O(n^2) comparisons atleast
